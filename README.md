- I wanted to create a star rating so I used this tutorial with a few additional pieces https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmhU_MoxNqQ
- Resources for neumorphic design: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mR_dxyajp0, https://www.justinmind.com/ui-design/neumorphism, https://neumorphism.io/#e0e0e0 (for shadow colours when using the green), https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/neumorphism-in-ui-design/

## Reflection

- I wanted to go for something very different stylistically, I chose neumorphic because it seemed simple but fun. I really enjoyed making my elements "pop in and out", I especially love the like buttons andI did spend a while just spam clicking them. I felt having a more "specific" style made styling easier because you only really have two choices for each element- should it be raised or depressed? Then I get to decide where the small splashes of colour went. I think that it also made it easier to create a more "website" looking website. I usually struggle with thinking my sites look more like "word documents" and I feel this was a good breakthrough with my website design abilities.
- I also felt I knew when to use useState more intuitevly, it was a much more enjoyable project than last weeks overall as I felt I had more of a handle of React.
